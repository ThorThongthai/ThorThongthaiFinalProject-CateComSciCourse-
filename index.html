    <h2>Happiness in Different Countries</h2>
    <p>
      For my project I wanted to look at happiness levels in different countries and
      compare them. To do this, I pulled from the 2021 World Happiness Report.
      I visualized the happiness of different countries in different ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s also very important to note that the 
      <a href="https://happiness-report.s3.amazonaws.com/2021/Appendix1WHR2021C2.pdf" target="_blank">
      2021 World Happiness Report</a> uses self-reported
      data. This means that happiness was measured by asking individuals to gauge how happy they
      think they feel. The specific question the report used was this: “Please imagine a ladder,
      with steps numbered from 0 at the bottom to 10 at the top. The top of the ladder represents
      the best possible life for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible
      life for you. On which step of the ladder would you say you personally feel you stand at
      this time?” Although the question is well formulated, there is still always an inherent
      bias to self-reported accounts of phenomena. I thought it was important to acknowledge
      the limitations of the dataset I pulled from and therefore acknowledge the limitations
      of my data visualizations as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      For my first data visualization, I created a world map with shades of the same color
      to represent Happiness levels in different countries. <strong>The darker the color,
        the happier the country. Grey means there is no data for that country.</strong>
      The advantage to this visualization is that you can see visually which regions of the
      world are happier than other regions. Comparisons between different continents become
      really easy. For example, you can see that people in North and South America seem to
      be happier than people in Africa.

    <p>
      For my second data visualization, I created a horizontal bar chart that ranks all of
      the countries from most happy to least happy. <strong>The x axis is happiness score.</strong>
    </p>
    <!--Horizontal Bar Chart-->
    <div id="Horizontal_Bar_Chart"></div>

    <p>
      For my third data visualization, I created a bubble chart where the size of the bubble
      corresponds with a country’s happiness level. The bigger the bubble, the happier the
      country. I thought that this data visualization was fun and looks cool. The advantage
      is similar to the bar chart where you can see with a glance which countries are happiest.

      Although my visualizations offer compelling ways to compare happiness levels between
      countries, it doesn’t offer much explanation to the factors that may be contributing to
      happiness. To evaluate these factors, I used data from the same 2021 World Happiness
      Report and drew linear regressions between different factors and happiness levels to see
      how correlated a given factor is to happiness levels.
      Here are my findings:
    </p>

    <img src="Social Support.png" width="500">
    <img src="Freedom to make life choices.png" width="500">
    <img src="Healthy life expectancy.png" width="500">
    <img src="GDP per capita.png" width="500">

    <p>
      As one can see, all of these factors seem to correlate with happiness to some degree.
      That being said, the correlation between the factors and happiness isn’t that strong,
      the r squared value ranging from 0.36 to 0.62. GDP per capita seems to be the factor
      that correlates with happiness the most, with a r squared value of 0.623.
